# WordProcessorTerminal
This is a very simple word processor that runs through cmd. You can create a text file or edit an existing one.
A batch file has been added as a separate file. You click on this file to automatically run the program. This saves having to change
directory and then run the java file everytime you wish to use the program.

I will add to this program. This is two days programming so far, so it is very early in the development stage.
